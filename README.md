# Google-s-SMS-retriever-API
Since we want to use all the latest features in the Android framework, we always need to use the latest version. As Android is advancing to restrict sensitive user data that forces applications to request permissions, the downside is that it's not reliable because users can deny and our features, that depends on permission, can never be reached until they allow the application to do something even if we explain it.  An example is when the app asks for permission in order to read sms, after the user filled out the phone number, to automatically pick up the sms pin code to log he in. If the user denies the permission and he can not see the entire content of the sms by pulling down the notification, he'll have to get out from your app just to memorize the code and come back to write it. Besides being annoying, he may not come back any more.
